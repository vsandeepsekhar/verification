<p>Will be implementing verification excellence assignments
features and verification plan can look like this :</p>
<p>
<br>1. Verification of Dual port RAM</br>
<br>Directed Feature Test:</br>
<br>------> Verification of Basic Read</br>
<br>------> Verification of Basic Write</br>
<br>------> Verification of back to back read (5 nos)</br>
<br>------> Verification of back to back write (5 nos)</br>
<br>Random Delays and corner cases:</br>
<br>------> Verification of back to back read with contrained random delays (1,2,3 clock cycles)</br>
<br>------> Verification of back to back write with contrained random delays (1,2,3 clock cycles)</br>
<br>------> Verification of rd followed by wr and vice versa</br>
</p>
<p>2. Verification of Synchronous FIFO </p>

<br>To be contibued...</br>
